Bigtable concepts
	Bigtable nodes and clusters
	Column families
	BigTable limits
	Key visualizer
BigQuery datatypes, bigquery limits (I/o operations, size, number of columns)
	BigQuery is optimized for high-read data
	Data stored on colossus
	Workers distribution. Dremel
	CREATE ROW ACCESS SECURITY, INFORMATION_SCHEMA, __TABLES__
	Nested and repeated fields,
		are used to improve repeated values in denormalized tables
	ARRAYS AND STRUCTS, JSON
		Nested Fields are Arrays
		Array . Mode REPEATED , list as array.dimension(s)
		Arrat . Should be the same Datatype
		Structs allow for differing data granularity in the same table
		Structs are linked to type RECORD, struct.dimension(s)
		Structs can have nested structs inside
	Partition Table
		Table migration table
		Creates Shards of information, Ingestion_time, integers
	Clustering
		By categorical data, at creation time
		Bigquery automaticlally re-clustering
